# Tablet waving pattern helper

A small tool to create a preview and instructions for a custom tablet weaving pattern: https://resah.github.io/tablet-weaving/

Still work in progress and currently supports the following features:

* Change number of 4-hole tablets
* Set thread colors for each hole
* Set initial S/Z-direction for each tablet
* Switch rotation direction for each row
* Pattern is stored in local storage
* Show back of pattern
* Switch rotation direction for a single tablet
* Link to pattern by URL
* Select template by name
* Setting thread thickness
* Convenience:
  * Minimize instructions panel
  * Minimize back view
  * Colour helper

Planned features:
* Set number of holes for tablets
* "Missed holeâ€œ or "pebble weave"
* Custom colour picker (maybe selectable from different versions)
* Inverted view (bottom-up, which seems to be used more often)
* PWA

Not planned for now:
* Set number of holes for each tablet individually
* Step without tablet rotation
* Switching tablet positions
